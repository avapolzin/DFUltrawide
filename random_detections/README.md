These files account for some random detections of fuzzy/interesting things in the UW images. Hopefully it's a good way to get a sense of the kinds of things that exist in these data. Because this is a public repository, these images are decoupled from coordinates -- check the Dragonfly Slack channel or the Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey Notion page for more specific locations + additional objects.
