`*_grid` files are observability grids for dwarf galaxies in UW at that distance/mass/age -- these were generated by injecting `ArtPop` models (assuming that the models followed both the size-mass relation and MZR) into a cutout from UW1040.

`*_comp_plot` files compare the same dwarf galaxy (modeled on COSMOS-dw1, see Polzin et al. 2021) with different instruments. These models were also generated using `ArtPop` and `phosim` was used to mimic the Rubin Obs. photometric properties. The detection per pixel detection significances should be accurate enough (based on the brightest pixel), but the _overall_ detection significance might not be (?), since it was not carefully computed. (Just something to keep in mind. These plots are probably best used for qualitative comparison anyway.)

`*_sbcontrast` speaks for itself -- will need to be rerun now that sbcontrast has been updated.

`*_overlap` shows either major HI or (higher resolution) optical surveys that overlap with the UW footprint. Good if you're interested in looking at galaxy gas content/SBF/... The observing status is from ~July 2021, so it no longer reflects the completeness of the survey.
